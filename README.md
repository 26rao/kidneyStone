Automated Kidney Stone Detection and Severity Grading via Deep Learning on Radiographs
Project Overview

This project implements a two-stage deep learning pipeline for automated kidney stone detection and severity estimation from radiographs (CT or ultrasound scans). The system localizes kidney stones using YOLOv8 and predicts severity using a ResNet-18-based regression model, providing a comprehensive diagnostic aid for clinicians.

Methodology
2.1 Overview
The pipeline consists of two stages:
Localization Stage 
Detects and localizes kidney stones in radiographs
More info cannot be provided as the project is still under review

Dataset
Radiographs (CT or ultrasound)  kidney stone images.
Images are preprocessed for normalization, resizing, and augmentation to improve model robustness

Dependencies
Python 3.x
PyTorch
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
YOLOv8 (Ultralytics library)
